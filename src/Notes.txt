parsed_page.css('b')[1] to [11] = job listing title
    [1] and [7] are unrelated to the jobs listings. Need to review.
        Aldaba.com does not always return the same number of elements
            It may or may not include ads and "ofertas destacadas" or highlighted (paid) jobs.
            use job descriptions to know the real count of jobs returned.
    parsed_page.css('b')[x].children = listing title

parsed_page.css('td.italica.gright')[0].children.text to [9].children.text = job listing description

parsed_page.css('font')[0].children.text to [10] = dates
    There are eleven elements so one of the dates (or more) might not correspond to the actual job listings. Need to review.
        could be [7] on this page.

parsed_page.css('a.ficha')[0].attribute("href").value to [9] = links for each job listing.
